## Dataset Title

Heart Disease Dataset

## Description

The Heart Disease Dataset is a widely used medical dataset for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic attributes. The dataset is commonly used in machine learning tasks such as classification, model evaluation, and healthcare analytics.

## Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease using health-related features.

## Dataset Source

The dataset is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is frequently used for academic and research purposes.

## Dataset Structure

Total Records: ~300 patients

Total Features: 13 input features + 1 target variable

Target Variable:

0 → No heart disease

1 → Presence of heart disease
